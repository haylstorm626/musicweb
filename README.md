# Music Web
Android app that takes your favorite music artist and displays a visual web of related artists. The app allows the user to look at artists' music, listen to a clip of any song, and add a song to a personal list.

This project is mostly an expirementation with an api. It only allows previews because for full songs the Spotify API required money that I did not have.

![Search Page](https://github.com/haylstorm626/musicweb/blob/master/img/search2.png "Search Page")

App opens to a search page where the user can search for an artist they like.

Search leads to a visual web surrounding the artist with similar artists. Tapping an artist's bubble leads to their page.

![Album Page](https://github.com/haylstorm626/musicweb/blob/master/img/album5.png "Album Page")

The artist's page lets the user browse their music, preview songs, and add to their personal list.
